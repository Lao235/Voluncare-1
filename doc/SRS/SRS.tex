\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
\paragraph{}
The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the Volunteer Recruitment System. It will explain the purpose and features of the system, the interfaces of the system and what the system will do. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system.

\subsection{Scope of Project}
\paragraph{}
This software system will be a Web Publishing System for a volunteer recruitment. This system will be designed for managers to apply some activities for volunteers to take part in. By participating the volunteer activities, the system will give some integrals to users for applying a high identity.
More specifically, this system is designed to allow an manager to manage publish some socially useful activities and courses. Users can participate these activities. Beside, by participating these activities, more integrals will be got for applying a new identity. Different identities have different preferential policies for buying the courses which will be good for users.
\subsection{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
The system has two active actors, the user and the manager. Both of them are required to log in before they can access to the system, but only the user can sign up, which suppose the user to complete the personal information. 
The system can mainly be divided into three parts. First of all, the manager is able to initiate or edit projects that can be generated with QR code and courses, and then the user can enroll his/herself into the projects or the courses that should be paid and checked by the manager. Both of them have the access to view projects and courses lists. Besides, the user has the access to check and edit his/her personal information, as well as to check credit record, member manual, study record and activity record. Another function is that the user can submit application for his/her status. The last part is that the manager has the approach to searching users and viewing users list, users` details and user` credit records. In addition, the manager can also modify user records, identity authentication, edit discount strategy or charge information, as well as add activity records or charge information.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
\paragraph{}
The next chapter, the Overall Description section, of this document gives an overview of the functionality of the product. It describes the informal requirements and is used to establish a context for the technical requirements specification in the next chapter.
The third chapter, Requirements Specification section, of this document is written primarily for the developers and describes in technical terms the details of the functionality of the product. 
Both sections of the document describe the same software product in its entirety, but are intended for different audiences and thus use different language. And the last chapter is the database of this project which describes the database tables will be used.
