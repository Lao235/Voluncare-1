\section{Cooperation}
	
	\paragraph{} We keep stand-up meetings in working days and have good atmosphere in general. We tried to maintain these meetings as simple as possible but getting straight to the point. However, lack of enthusiasm could be an issue in consequence of another module's coursework and cold weather.
	
\section{Problems Encountering}
	
	\subsection{Wrong Estimation of Working Hours}
	\paragraph{} Because of using new technique i.e. AugularJS, we need to learn it and build the website concurrently, then we can hardly finish backlog by pre-decided working hours. Working hours should recalculate before new sprint. 
	
	\subsection{Tardiness of Progress}
	\paragraph{} Due to the reason as below section described, several backlogs can not accomplish on time and lead to incompleteness of burn down chart. We need to reselect the main functions which the first version needs, and have more passion to the project.
	
	\section{Experience Obtaining}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Accuracy in working hours calculation.
		\item More confidence in AngularJS.
	\end{itemize}
